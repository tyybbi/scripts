# scripts

Little utility scripts written in Bash or Python for author's own entertainment.

## distrostate

A script to check how mixed (or unmixed) your Debian installation is. More
useful if you're running testing/unstable rather than stable.

## lenormand

Randomize a Lenormand spread of any size (1-36).

## pull-all

Simple script to update Vim plugins that are installed via git. It basically
does "git pull" in each plugin directory that has a .git directory in it.
(Uses Vim's native package loading system.)
